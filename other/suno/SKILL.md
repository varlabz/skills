## Critical Placement Rule

**Metatags go ONLY in the Lyrics field, NOT the Style Prompt.** Putting structure tags like `[Verse]` or `[Chorus]` in the Style field will be ignored or misinterpreted by the model. The Style field describes overall sound; the Lyrics field holds lyrics + metatags that control section-by-section behavior.

---

## Adaptive Output Sections

Match your output to what the user actually asked for — don't force every section on every request:

| User intent | Include |
|-------------|---------|
| Full song ("write me a song about...") | Style Tags → Song Structure → Lyrics → Final Result → Production Notes |
| Refine an existing prompt | Same as full song, but preserve original theme/mood where possible |
| Just style tags / experiment | Style Tags only (multiple combos if helpful) + brief rationale |
| Just lyrics | Song Structure metatags + Lyrics + minimal Style Tags context |
| Extend a track | Production Notes focused on extend workflow + extension structure |

When the user asks for a full song, provide ALL sections. When they ask for something partial, give just what's useful.

---

## Rules (Full Song / Refine Prompt)

For complete songs, provide these sections in order:

**Style Tags:** A comma-separated list of genres, sub-genres, moods, vocal descriptions, and BPM. **Hard cap: keep the Style field ≤ 200 characters.** In v5, exceeding this truncates mid-word and can produce garbled results. (Example: Melodic Techno, Dark Ethereal Female Vocals, Pulsating Bass, 126 BPM)

**Song Structure:** Use Suno metatags in **square brackets [ ] placed on their own line in the Lyrics field**, directly before each section. Metatags are case-insensitive and can be stacked: `[Chorus] [Belted] [Euphoric]`. Place your most important tags in the first 20–30 words of the lyrics for maximum impact.

**Lyrics:** High-quality, rhythmic lyrics with clear meter. Write v5-style lyrics that include performative directions — Suno v5 interprets parenthetical stage directions literally: `(soft sigh)`, `(drums build)`, or `(whispered ad-lib)` will be performed by the model.

**Final Result:** Merged Song Structure and Lyrics into one copy-paste block with metatags embedded in the lyrics.

**Production Notes:** Tips on how to use the "Extend" feature, v5-specific workflow advice, and where to place the "Drop" for maximum impact.

## Suno Version Awareness (v5 / v5.5)

Suno v5 released September 2025; v5.5 added personalization features in March 2026. Key differences from earlier versions:

**Metatag behavior:**
- `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]` — stable across all versions.
- `[Instrumental Break]`, `[Drop]`, `[Build-Up]`, `[Breakdown]`, `[Post-Chorus]`, `[Hook]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Fade Out]`, `[End]` — all work in v5. Use the full catalog (see below).
- **Parenthetical modifiers** like `[verse: soft]` now affect dynamics, tone, AND mic proximity in v5 — use specific directives like `[close-mic verse, breath audible, low dynamics]` instead of vague ones.
- **Tag stacking on one line works:** `[Chorus] [Female Vocal] [Belted] [Euphoric]` is a valid and powerful combination.

**Style field constraints (v5):**
- **Hard 200-character cap.** Exceeding it truncates mid-word — `"acoustic"` becoming `"acou"` can produce random results. Always stay ≤ 200 chars.
- **Tag order matters.** The first tag has ~2x the weight of position 2; by position 6 you're at ~15% influence. Put your most important descriptors first.
- **Effect tags propagate globally** in v5 unless overridden per-section. `[reverb-heavy]` in Style affects the whole song.
- **Contradictory tags render visibly** in v5 (v4 would silently pick one). Avoid mixing opposing descriptors like `lo-fi` + `crisp`.

**Vocal behavior (v5):**
- If you list multiple voice types (`male vocal, female vocal, duet`), the **first voice dominates**. Tag order within vocal clusters matters.
- **BPM markers are accurate to ±3 BPM** in v5 (was ±10–15 BPM in v4).

**Micro-genre precision:** v5 knows distinct micro-genres that v4 would blend: `hyperpop`, `phonk`, `brazilian funk`, `trap metal`, etc. Use specific genre names rather than broad ones.

**Synonym divergence (v5):** Words like `warm`, `organic`, `analog`, and `saturated` now produce distinctly different results:
- `warm` = EQ curve (roll-off highs)
- `organic` = playing style (rubato, human imperfection)
- `analog` = production tools (tape, tubes, circuitry)
- `saturated` = signal chain (harmonic distortion)

Use the term that matches your actual sonic intent.

**v3 fallback:** For older accounts still on v3, stick to basic structure tags: `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`. Avoid advanced tags like `[Drop]` or `[Build-Up]`.

## Complete Structure Tag Reference (v5)

| Category | Tags |
|----------|------|
| **Structure** | `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Verse 1]`, `[Verse 2]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Post-Chorus]`, `[Hook]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Break]`, `[Instrumental Break]`, `[Final Chorus]`, `[Outro]`, `[Refrain]`, `[Tag]`, `[Coda]` |

## Parenthetical Instructions (v5)

Suno v5 interprets text inside **parentheses `( )`** as literal performance directions — not lyrics. The model performs whatever you describe inside them. This is one of the most powerful features in v5 for both vocal and instrumental tracks.

**How they work:**
- Parenthetical instructions go **inside the Lyrics field**, on the same line as (or directly after) a metatag.
- They are **not sung as words** — they are instructions for *how* the music should sound.
- They affect dynamics, tone, instrumentation, mic proximity, and performance style.
- Multiple parenthetical instructions can be stacked on one line, separated by commas.

**Examples:**
- `(soft sigh)` → the model performs a soft sigh sound
- `(drums build)` → the model builds drum intensity
- `(whispered ad-lib)` → whispered vocal interjection
- `(heavy guitar riff in 7/8, sparse and syncopated)` → plays a heavy guitar riff in 7/8 time, sparse and syncopated
- `(distorted bass takes the lead, gritty percussive plucking)` → distorted bass plays prominently with a gritty, percussive style
- `(everything drops, synthesizer drones, distant guitar feedback)` → full arrangement cuts out, leaving synth drones and guitar feedback
- `(double-time drums, layered guitar harmonies, synth bass rumble)` → all instruments play at double-time with layered guitars and deep synth bass

**Parenthetical instructions for instrumental tracks:**
When using the Instrumental toggle, parenthetical instructions become your primary way to direct the arrangement. Without lyrics, Suno needs explicit musical directions:
- Describe **what instrument plays** and **how**: `(jagged angular guitar solo, dissonant intervals, chromatic runs)`
- Describe **arrangement density**: `(everything drops, sparse cymbal hits, tension builds slowly)`
- Describe **energy shifts**: `(drums accelerate, bass returns with increasing intensity, guitars layer in)`
- Describe **time feel**: `(syncopated bass and guitar riff in 7/8, deliberate footsteps)`

**Best practices:**
- Be **specific and concrete** — avoid vague terms like "nice" or "good." Use descriptive musical language.
- Place the **most important instruction first** — Suno weights the beginning of the parenthetical more heavily.
- Keep them **concise** — 5–15 words per parenthetical works best. Long instructions may be truncated.
- Use **action verbs** — "plays," "builds," "drops," "crashes," "trades," "decays."
- Combine **instrument + technique + mood** for maximum control: `(guitar and bass trade phrases, call and response, tense atmosphere)`
- Parenthetical instructions **override** generic style tags for that section — they are section-specific.

**Parenthetical vs. Metatag — what goes where:**
| Square brackets `[ ]` | Parentheses `( )` |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Section structure: `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` | Performance direction: `(heavy guitar riff)` |
| Vocal/instrument type: `[Guitar Solo]` | How it sounds: `(jagged, dissonant, chromatic)` |
| Energy level: `[Drop]` | What happens: `(everything hits at once, double-time)` |
| Global style (in Style field) | Section-specific direction (in Lyrics field) |

## Instrumental Mode & Negative Prompts

When the user wants music without vocals, guide them on Suno's UI controls rather than trying to force "no vocals" through text prompts alone:

- **Instrumental toggle (primary method):** In Custom Mode, enable the **"Instrumental"** switch. This is the only reliable way to get no vocals — it deletes lyrics and closes the lyric panel in v5+.
- **Text reinforcement for instrumentals (v5):** If the toggle isn't available or you want extra insurance, use `[instrumental only, no vocals, no adlibs]` in the Lyrics field with NO vocal descriptors anywhere in Style. Also add musical direction brackets showing what SHOULD happen: `[Guitar Solo]`, `[Synth Pad]`.
- **Partial vocals:** For spoken word, voiceovers, or ambient textures, use style tags like "spoken word", "ambient texture" alongside the instrumental toggle for best results.
- **Backing vocal guidance:** When describing lead + backing vocals, specify in Style: "Male Lead Vocal, Female Backing Harmonies". In Lyrics, use `[Backing Vocals]` or `[Harmonies]` metatags before those sections.

**Note on v5 negative prompting:** Suno v5 introduced a dedicated **negative prompt** field (available to Pro/Premier subscribers) where you can specify what to exclude — e.g., "no drums, no female vocals". Mention this as an option for advanced users.

## Guidelines for Output

**Avoid generic terms:** Instead of "Rock," use "1970s Hard Rock" or "Modern Post-Grunge." In v5, specific genre names produce distinctly different results than broad ones.

**Vocal Styling — be specific and varied.** Don't just say "male vocals" or "female vocals." Use Suno's actual metatag system for vocal delivery:

| Metatag | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `[Male Vocal]` / `[Female Vocal]` | Lead voice gender |
| `[Whispered]` | Soft, intimate, breathy — great for intros or bridges |
| `[Belted]` | Powerful, full-voiced singing — use for chorus climaxes |
| `[Falsetto]` | High, airy head-voice — emotional and delicate |
| `[Raspy]` | Gritty, rough texture — rock and blues |
| `[Breathy]` | Soft and airy delivery |
| `[Melismatic]` | Complex vocal runs (R&B style) |
| `[Spoken]` / `[Spoken Word]` | Spoken, not sung — intros, bridges, narration |
| `[Rap]` / `[Rap Verse]` | Rhythmic spoken-word delivery |
| `[Ad Libs]` | Spontaneous vocal interjections and runs |
| `[Duet]` | Two vocalists singing together |
| `[Choir]` / `[Group Vocals]` | Multiple voices, choral or group arrangement |
| `[Backing Vocals]` / `[Harmonies]` | Layered harmonies or call-and-response |
| `[Auto-Tune]` | Robotic/smooth pitch-corrected sound |
| `[Phone Vocals]` | Thin, telephone-quality filtered vocals |
| `[Lo-Fi Vocals]` | Degraded, vintage-sounding vocal quality |

**Combine tags on one line for layered instructions:**
- `[Chorus] [Female Vocal] [Belted] [Euphoric]` → euphoric power female chorus
- `[Verse 1] [Male Vocal] [Whispered] [Acoustic Guitar]` → intimate whispered male verse
- `[Bridge] [Melancholic] [Cello] [Reverb]` → sad orchestral bridge

**Formatting:** Always use code blocks for the "Style Tags", "Song Structure + Lyrics" (with embedded metatags), and "Final Result" so I can easily copy them.

## Using the Music Glossary

For precise musical terminology, read **[the full music glossary](references/suno-terms.md)** — it covers Tempo & Rhythm, Dynamics & Expression, Song Structure, Melody & Harmony, Genres & Styles, Instrumentation & Texture, Vocal Techniques, Production & Effects, and Advanced Concepts.

**When to use terms from the glossary:**
- **Tempo terms** (Adagio, Allegro, Rubato) — when BPM alone doesn't convey feel; e.g., "Allegro with rubato sections." In v5, BPM markers are accurate to ±3 BPM so you can trust them.
- **Dynamics terms** (Crescendo, Fortissimo, Pianissimo) — for clear intensity shifts; embed in style tags like "pianissimo verse building to fortissimo chorus."
- **Texture terms** (Sparse, Dense, Layering) — when describing arrangement density; e.g., "sparse verses with dense choruses."
- **Production terms** (Tape Saturation, Sidechain Compression, Reverb-Drenched) — for specific sonic character in style tags. Note: in v5, effect tags propagate globally unless overridden per-section.

**Combine terms creatively:** e.g., "syncopated bass groove with crescendo into falsetto chorus" or "sparse piano and vocals building to dense orchestral arrangement."

Use only English words for Suno tags and song styles.
